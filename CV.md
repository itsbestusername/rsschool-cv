I'm a student of RS School. When i was 18 years old i wanted to go to university on programmer. Unfortunately i chose to work in the bank. And now I'm going to study hard because i really want to change my career field. And i think i can do it because i'm purposeful, multitasking and orderly enough. I always appreciated an accuracy in my work so i never disregard deadline.
